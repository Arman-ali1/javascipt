## hoisting
###Hoisting is a fundamental concept in JavaScript related to variable and function declarations. It ###refers to the behavior of how declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the ###compilation phase, before the code is executed. This allows you to use variables and functions in ###your code before they are actually declared.
```
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 10;

var x;        // Declaration is hoisted
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
x = 10;       // Initialization remains in place

```
