bind()===method--

In JavaScript, the bind() method is used to create a new function that, when invoked, has its this value set to a specific object. It allows you to explicitly specify the value of this for a function, regardless of how it's called. This can be particularly useful when working with event handlers, callbacks, or when you want to create a new function with a fixed context.

"In JavaScript, the call() method is a built-in method for functions that allows you to call a function with a specific this value and a set of arguments. It is used to explicitly set the context (the value of this) for a function and provide arguments to that function."

```

function bindfun(){
    console.log(`name==${this.name} and  city==${this.city}`);
}


let obj={
    name:"Alii",
    city:"Bangalore"
}
let bfun=bindfun.bind(obj);
bfun()
// obj.binfFun()


```

#apply() method ==

same work as call() but it take input in spred formate like as a array take entire multiple inpute and bind then in a array and padd as argument
