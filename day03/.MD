##closure
###Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript and are created when a function is defined within another function. A closure allows an inner function to access the variables and parameters of an outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing. This behavior provides a way to encapsulate data and create private variables and functions, which is crucial for various programming patterns in JavaScript.

Here's a simple example to illustrate closures in JavaScript:
```
function closure(){

    let x = 10;

    return function(){

        let n=12;

        console.log(n);

        console.log(x);

    }

}

var innerFunc = closure();
innerFunc();

```
###deference between Currying and closure
```
//Currying
const addFive = (a) => {
    const curriedAdd = (b) => {
        return a + b;
        };
        return curriedAdd;
        };
        console.log(addFive(5)(6)); // Output: 11
        //Closure
        var outerFunction = ()=>{
            let counter = 34;
            return function() {
                return ++counter;
                }
            };
            
const res=  outerFunction();
const fres=res();
console.log("res",fres);


```
##Currying and closures are related concepts in JavaScript, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.
Currying: Currying is a functional programming technique that focuses on transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of unary (single-argument) functions. It's primarily used to create more specialized functions, improve code modularity, and enable partial function application.
Closures: Closures are a fundamental feature of JavaScript that allows functions to retain access to variables from their containing (outer) scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are used for encapsulation, data privacy, and maintaining persistent state.
