##closure
###Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript and are created when a function is defined within another function. A closure allows an inner function to access the variables and parameters of an outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing. This behavior provides a way to encapsulate data and create private variables and functions, which is crucial for various programming patterns in JavaScript.

Here's a simple example to illustrate closures in JavaScript:
```
function closure(){

    let x = 10;

    return function(){

        let n=12;

        console.log(n);

        console.log(x);

    }

}

var innerFunc = closure();
innerFunc();

```
